☀️ **Project Overview:** 

A web application that estimates the installation cost and savings of a solar power system for your home or business.
Built with a responsive and modern UI using React and Tailwind CSS for a smooth user experience.
Hosted on Netlify for fast, global delivery and easy continuous deployment.



⚙️ **Key Features:**

User-friendly input forms to gather data like average energy usage, roof size, and electricity rates.
Instant cost and savings estimates are displayed as interactive charts.
Integration of local energy rates to produce more accurate calculations.
Interactive graphs (e.g., using Recharts) to visualize:
- Total cost vs. potential savings over time.
- Payback period and ROI.
- Lightweight, fast-loading UI for both desktop and mobile.





🧑‍💻 **Technologies Used:**

React (Vite) for a fast, modular front-end.
Tailwind CSS for modern, utility-first styling.
Charting libraries (e.g., Recharts) for data visualization.
Hosted on Netlify with automated builds.
Responsive design for accessibility across devices.





🌍 **Impact & Benefits :**

Empowers homeowners with accurate estimates before they invest in solar.
Promotes sustainable energy by making solar adoption decisions clearer.

Reduces friction in going solar by answering key questions like:
- "How much will I save per year?"
- "What’s my break-even point?"
- "Is my location suitable?"





🎯 **Future Enhancements:**

Add a feature for comparing different solar panel brands and their efficiency.
Include a financing calculator to show savings with loans or incentives.
Fetch real-time solar panel prices & local utility rates via APIs.
Offer a downloadable report/PDF of the estimate.




# 📄 Project Description 

Solar Cost Estimator is a responsive, interactive web application built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. It enables homeowners and businesses to estimate the cost of installing solar panels, projected savings over time, and return on investment — all in just a few clicks. Hosted on Netlify for fast, reliable performance, the app takes user inputs like average energy consumption, electricity rates, and rooftop area to generate customized solar cost estimates and savings projections instantly. Visual graphs and metrics help users make informed decisions about transitioning to clean energy.





# 🌍 Real-Time Use Case 

Imagine a homeowner who is curious about going solar but doesn’t know where to start. They visit the Solar Cost Estimator, enter their average monthly electricity bill and approximate roof size, then instantly see:
- The estimated installation cost for the required number of solar panels.
- The projected yearly savings on electricity bills.
- The approximate payback period before the solar system pays for itself.
- Visual charts showing cumulative savings over the next 10–20 years.

With this easy and instant calculation — without waiting for a salesperson — the homeowner can decide whether solar power is worth pursuing, potentially taking the next step toward a more sustainable, cost-effective energy future.
